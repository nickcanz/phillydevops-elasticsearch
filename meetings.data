Please message me if youd like to give a 5 minute talk. Your topic could be anything web performance related, for example a tool youve recently used, an interesting project youre doing/have done/are about to do, or even a forum to bounce ideas off (or get suggestions from) the whole group.\n\nGuest talk outline\n\nDevOps, when done right, usually goes unnoticed. It’s only when something breaks that all eyes turn to IT. If your boss only sees you when the app is down, however, that’s not really doing your career any favours. In this session we’ll talk about how to prove your value to the organisation by looking at the positive side – that is, how much money you’ve saved your company. We’ll take a look at how you can use tools like Chef, Puppet, Sensu and Logstash to quantify your value to your company. After this session, you’ll be able to walk into a meeting with your boss ready to talk about your value to the company (and to ask for a raise).\n\nGuest speaker bio\n\nTom Levey is a Tech Evangelist at AppDynamics. Tom is responsible for promoting best practices of application performance management (APM) for distributed applications running in cloud, virtual and physical environments. Tom has spent 6 years helping organisations to build robust APM technology strategies and has the scars to show for it. He received his BSC in Computer Science and after working as a Java application developer he decided someone really needed to help the world optimise the performance of their applications!\n\nBeer amp; pizza sponsored by AppDynamics, a next generation Application Performance Management solution.

With a little help from everyones favourite 80s action hero, well undergo a whistle-stop tour of the philosophy, culture and tooling behind this buzzword, specifically aimed at Java developers. Well also look at a real-world case study from Instant Access Technologies Ltd, and explore the key role that DevOps has played during a successful upgrade of the epoints customer loyalty platform to support increasing traffic.\n\nThe core discussion will focus on the challenges encountered as we moved from a JVM-based monolithic app deployed into a data centre on a big bang schedule, to a platform of loosely-coupled components, all being continuously deployed into the Cloud. We will conclude the talk by recommending a learning path for Java developers who are interested to learn more about DevOps.\n\nThis will be a 45 min PPT presentation\n\nWho should attend:\n\nAnyone interested in learning more about DevOps or how to improve the working relationship between Developers, QA and Ops, with the ultimate goal of deploying working software in an efficient and effective manner\n\nBio:\n\nDaniel Bryant is a hands-on CTO working for IAT Ltd, a small company that specialises in increasing customer loyalty. In his spare time Daniel contributes to open source projects, and has a passion for sharing his knowledge through blog posts, writing articles for well known technology websites and also presenting at international conferences, including JavaOne, Devoxx and FOSDEM. Daniel is a strong supporter of Agile methodologies, and constantly seeks to improve the effectiveness of the teams he leads. He is embracing the DevOps movement, and has had some success (and a lot of fun) experimenting with changing culture, processes and tooling alongside some amazing colleagues at IAT. Daniel is an Associate in the London Java Community (LJC), and he sits on the LJC JCP committee and assists in running LJC hack days, specifically for OpenJDK (the RI for Java).\n\nAgenda:\n\n19:15: Doors open.\n\n19:15/30 approx: Main presentation\n\n20:00/20:15: Networking and informal discussion at: Hotel Ibis - London, Euston, St Pancras - 3 Cardington Street, London, NW1 2LW\n\nPlease Note:\n\nThis event is being held at UCL in the UCL Medical Sciences Building -  Room number: 131 A V Hill Lecture Theatre, Malet Place, WC1E 6BT.\n\nPlease refer to this map: http://www.ucl.ac.uk/maps?locationID=89\n\nWe will head to Hotel Ibis - London, Euston, St Pancras - 3 Cardington Street, London, NW1 2LW - for networking and further informal discussion after the event: http://www.ibishotel.com/gb/hotel-0921-ibis-london-euston-st-pancras/location.shtml\n\nEvent organised by the awesome folk at RecWorks - check out the blog here:\n\nhttp://blog.recworks.co.uk/","how_to_find_us":"Please refer to this map - http://www.ucl.ac.uk/maps?locationID=89","name":"Chuck Norris Doesnt Do DevOps... but Java Developers might benefit!","headcount":0}'
