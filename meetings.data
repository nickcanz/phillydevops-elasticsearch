Lightning talk  by Scott Bellware: </p> <p><b>The SOLID Design Principles and Why They Matter</b></p> <p>You can get code done without ever paying attention to design principles. They can appear academic and philosophical, and have little bearing on the tasks you have to get done. Yet for those who already have a grasp of design principles, theye the most critical aspect of getting work done. In fact, theye predictors for how fast you go, and how soon your project will run out of steam and start experiencing the typical software project productivity collapse. Design principles encode the mistakes that software developers make before the developers realize that they are mistakes. They allow you to head-off mistakes before they become delays. They clarify the difference between merely getting things done, and doing things now that don become next week slow down. This quick presentation is a quick introduction to some of the most critical design principles, and the productivity qualities that they support.</p> <p><i>Scott Bellware was an early adopter of Agile Development in late-2000, and has been practicing, teaching, coaching, clarifying, and improving ever since. Scott is an avid student of the effect of software design on productivity, and the application of the Toyota Way (a.k.a. Lean) to software development. Scott has been up to his elbows in all aspects of software development for over thirty years, from mainframes to PCs, from RDBMS to Big Data, from client-server to Web, and from desktops to mobile.</i></p> <p>2.

Because it built atop of Riak, Riak CS can achieve the same horizontal scalability, fault-tolerance, and high availability as Swift, but in a much more more operationally-friendly way. With Keystone integration and Swift API compatibility, Riak CS can now serve as a drop-in replacement for Swift in many deployments.</p> <p>We will explore the architecture underlying Riak CS and discuss why you should care that operators enjoy working with it. Learn how Riak CS can replace or coexist with Swift in the OpenStack ecosystem to solve large object storage and scaling problems.</p> <p><b>Speaker Bio:</b></p> <p>Hector Castro works at Basho Technologies, the sponsors of Riak and Riak CS. Previously, he was a software engineer at Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS), where he worked on enabling full-text search for Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) documents. He also co-organizes Philly DevOps, a DevOps user group in Philadelphia.</p> <p>\n\n<b>Title</b>: Cloudifying High Availability</p> <p><b>Abstract</b>: Cross region and cross cloud high availability, a real life use case: Achieving high levels of availability and disaster recovery in a cloud environment requires the implementation of patterns and practices that introduce redundancy through multi-zone, multi-region, and multi-cloud deployments. As we move towards implementing higher availability, we cannot escape the direct increase in the accidental complexity of the deployment architecture resulting from lack of cloud portability and deployment lifecycle automation. We present a solution approach implemented by a real-world user for achieving high availability and disaster recovery using the Cloudify open source framework. This approach applies to not just AWS, but also other public clouds and private cloud environments such as OpenStack. The resulting reference architecture provides portable PostgreSQL replication and disaster recovery as well as application tier scalability across zones, regions, and public/private clouds through a unified deployment workflow.</p> <p><b>Speaker Bio: </b>Ali Hodroj is a Director of Solution Architecture and Technology Evangelist at GigaSpaces working with small and large organizations within financial services, retail, telecommunications, and internet media on their Cloud Computing, In-Memory Computing, and Scalability use cases. Prior to joining GigaSpaces, Ali spent his days in biomedical informatics working with big data, distributed computing, and JEE technologies. </p> <p>Ali’s archives on GigaSpaces Blog: <a href=\"http://blog.gigaspaces.com/author/ali/\"><a href=\"http://blog.gigaspaces.com/author/ali/\" class=\"linkified\">http://blog.gigaspaces.com/author/ali/</a></a></p>","name":"High Availability in the Cloud with Basho & GigaSpaces","headcount":0}'

At the time products like CFEngine and Puppet were the two main tools promoting this new way of doing operations and sharing within operations and software development. A year later Chef was born and I was fortunate enough to join Opscode as the 9th employee as an evangelist preaching this disruptive form of collaboration and automation. At the time a majority of IT infrastructure was managed by what I called the “Bob’s” of the world. Bob’s scripts, Bob’s directories and Bob to death do us part. Trying to explain to Bob the benefits of collaboration and software engineering principles was a hard fought battle over the years. One of the compelling events that helped propel these ideas (what we now call Devops) was cloud computing in the form of IaaS for compute resources.  Fast forward to 2014 and these infrastructure automation and collaboration battles still exist but the battles are far less bloody. Now a new war is emerging in the network operations and engineering space. The same argument for network operations adopting these principles is the same as system ops; however, now the new compelling events are network virtualization and Software Defined Networks in cloud infrastructures.  Cloud engineers and network operations are dealing with the complexities of managing a new breed of software based network gear like Arista, Cumulus and Insieme along with virtualized network infrastructure like Openvswitch, Openflow, OpenDaylight and NSX. Configuration tools are starting to get more sophisticated on these virtualized networks doing things like automated VLAN to Port mapping and basic system hardening. Chef and Puppet both have introduced primitives supporting platforms like Arista and Cumulus Networks. Help me start the discussion of what Devops and Openstack Networking really could mean.</p>","how_to_find_us":"When you enter the parking lot come all the way around to the left into a smaller lot between two buildings.

And youe got to array your experience — both vicarious and direct — on this latticework of models.  What are the models? Well, the first rule is that youe got to have multiple models — because if you just have one or two that youe using, the nature of human psychology is such that youl torture reality so that it fits your models, or at least youl think it does. So youe got to have multiple models. And the models have to come from multiple disciplines—because all the wisdom of the world is not to be found in one little academic department.\" </p> <p>More information: <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/kee-siong-ng/23/414/98b\"><a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/kee-siong-ng/23/414/98b\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.linkedin.com/pub/kee-siong-ng/23/414/98b</a></a></p> <p>• What kind of industries will the projects be focused on: Finance / Banking, Retail, IT , Healthcare</p> <p>• How much time can you commit?

The current software environment demands teams that are capable of dripping software releases to the public by continuously deploying features. Modern teams are increasingly eschew normal operations support for DevOps - where the systems maintenance and monitoring is done by the software developers.</p> <p>These ways of working are only possible where features can be delivered eat to metal by the software devs - from human factors and design (usually in the browser) through to the server and load distribution infrastructure - down through persistent storage to the disk and back up to end user.</p> <p>Traditional heterogeneous environments, for instance client-side javascript speaking to server side Ruby speaking SQL to persistent storage, are increasingly problematic in this world. Each transition between two languages creates an impedance gap which slows down development and debugging and (usually) fractures the teams. Node.js is an attempt to create an impedance-free development environment by having a common language (Javascript) client-side and server-side. Some people don think bring the callback single threaded model to the server is wise. However the rise of support for source maps in the browser means that ompile to js languages are becoming viable options. Clojure Script has led the way.</p> <p>LuvvieScript is an attempt to bring pattern-matching, event-driven, actor-based functional programming to the browser in a strict sub-set of Erlang (but not OTP!).  The browser is intrinsically low concurrency (around 10ish hings on a normal web page) and needs only primitive restart semantics.</p> <p>The production toolchain for LuvvieScript is to take a syntactically valid Erlang module compile it to core Erlang and transpile that to a valid javascript Abstract Syntax Tree (the Parser API from Mozilla). That JS AST can then be manipulated with normal Javascript syntax tools before being converted to valid Javacript with an associated source map using tools like ESCodegen. Additional runtime requirements (for instance dependent modules that require co-loading) can be specified using custom attributes in Erlang which enable the developer to arbitrarily annotate the Erlang Abstract Syntax Tree.</p> <p>The resulting deployment environment will include an in-page client-side un-time and a set of server-side Erlang libraries that will encapsulate the browser-server comms enabling the front and back-end processes to send each other messages transparently (and front-end processes to send each other ones too). The developer will no longer directly script the Dom - but operate on a client-side model which will be rendered to the Dom. In this world user actions (mouse clicks, key presses, etc, etc) will present to the developer as messages and have to be actively subscribed to - making for a recognizably en server style of client-side programming.</p> <p>About The Author:</p> <p>Gordon Guthrie has been programming since the (late) 1970s, was Chief Technical Architect at <a href=\"http://if.com/\">if.com</a> - the Service Architect at the City of Edinburgh and more recently CEO/CTO of Vixo.

These tools do a great job at allocating infrastructure resources and configuring them. But in reality, when deploying and managing complete application stacks, there’s much more to it. You need things to be done in a certain order; there are dependencies to consider and information to share between your application tiers, and then there’s everything related to post deployment - recovering from failures, scaling and continuously deploying your code, to name some.

With the ever increasing complexity involved in today’s technology, designers and developers are having to become more and more specialized. The greatest potential for innovation lies at the intersection between disciplines. Traditional brainstorming, used for decades and based on rapid idea generation free from critique, no longer is well suited to tackle the big sticky questions when everyone in the room is approaching the problem from the same knowledge base. Balanced teams of representatives from multiple disciplines focused on collaboration and continuous delivery have a greater chance of solving problems than siloed specialists.</p> <p>This talk will dive into strategies both new and old drawn from a variety of domains that can be used to facilitate creative group thinking and drive innovation. These techniques are drawn from and inspired by companies large and small, the arts, design firms and case studies from my work at Carbon Five. They will show how conflicting views guided in a structured manner toward resolution have the best chance for problem solving.</p> <p>About Courtney<br/>Courtney Hemphill is a Lead Developer at Carbon Five in San Francisco, CA. Over the past 10+ years, Courtney has used Agile and Lean techniques in a wide variety of web and mobile projects for clients including SFMOMA, Skype, Sharethrough, and BookRenter.</p> <p>An outspoken advocate for integrating design processes into quick development cycles, Courtney and her teams consistently deliver high quality design and development for applications that test both code and interactions with real customers. She also coaches and speaks about techniques that optimize this feedback loop.</p> <p>Courtney organizes events with Women Who Code and RailsBridge in San Francisco. She has mentored at both LUXr and South by Southwest Interactive and is a regular contributor to the Balanced Team group. Courtney also finds a healthy amount of time to unplug from the internets, traveling in search of the best rock climbing spots in the world, always returning to her primary stomping ground in Yosemite Valley. Twitter: @chemphill</p> <p><b>Presentation - How Constraints Cultivate Growth by Shay Howe</b></p> <p>In order for peace and progress to occur, rules are necessary. The same thought can be applied to designing and developing websites. Nowadays, our options are endless and as designers and developers we can build any website or application we wish. What these options don guarantee, however, is that what we build will be of any quality or fulfill our users needs. Fortunately, we can rely on constraints to ensure our products are sound.</p> <p>By setting constraints, we force ourselves to be more productive. They help us make decisions, creating focus around the problem we are trying to solve. They improve our consistency, which provides a better experience for our users. And they help us grow, a valuable asset in times of innovation.</p> <p>Within this talk, Shay will dive into different constraints and their benefits to building websites. Constraints are good and, when leveraged properly, allow us to truly flourish. It your turn to go on the swings. Enjoy it.</p> <p>About Shay As a designer and front end developer, Shay Howe has a passion for solving problems while building creative and intuitive products. Shay specializes in product design and interface development, specialties in which he regularly writes and speaks about. Currently he is the Director of Product at Belly, helping build the world best loyalty program. Additionally, Shay helps co-organize Chicago Camps, Refresh Chicago, and UX Happy Hour.</p> <p>\n\n\nThis a joint meetup with GOTO. Please register <a href=\"http://www.eventbrite.com/e/goto-night-with-courtney-hemphill-and-shaye-howe-tickets-10744502095\">on eventbrite</a>. RSVPs on this meetup will NOT get you through security!</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.eventbrite.com/e/goto-night-with-courtney-hemphill-and-shaye-howe-tickets-10744502095\"><a href=\"http://www.eventbrite.com/e/goto-night-with-courtney-hemphill-and-shaye-howe-tickets-10744502095\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.eventbrite.com/e/goto-night-with-courtney-hemphill-and-shaye-howe-tickets-10744502095</a></a></p>","name":"Balanced Teams & Cultivating Growth","headcount":0}'

But what is the best way to install the relevant artifacts during development or as part of your deployment pipeline? In this talk, we will discuss the techniques and tooling required to implement efficient, flexible, and most importantly, automated deployment strategies to local and remote web containers with Gradle.</p> <p><br/>Starting with the developer machine, we will look at rapid software development techniques to embedded and standalone containers. Remote containers pose more complex requirements to the deployment process; to mention just a few: explicit container lifecycle control (like starting and stopping the container), rolling or parallel deployments, writing and executing deployment tests to verify the application operability. Gradle can help you tackle these challenges in a pragmatic way. This session mainly focusses on JVM-based applications and runtime environments.</p> <p><b>About the Speaker:</b></p> <p>Benjamin Muschko is a software engineer with more than 10 years of experience in developing and delivering business applications.

I will show how these methods work and how to implement them using Apache Mahout.</p> <p>Systems such as the Open Time Series Database (Open TSDB) make good use of the ability of HBase, MapR tables and related databases to store columns sparsely.  This allows a single row to store many time samples and allows raw scans to retrieve a large number of samples very quickly for visualization or analysis.  Typically, older data points are batched together and compressed to save space. At high insertion rates, this approach falters largely because of the limited insert/update rate of HBase.  In such situations, it is often better to short segments of data and insert batches that span short time ranges rather than inserting individual data points.</p> <p>When inserting compressed batches in this fashion, there are a number of obvious strategies that can be used.  General compression utilities such as gzip do not normally provide particularly high compression rates.  Bespoke crafted compression systems may provide point solutions with high compression rates, but they are generally fairly time-intensive to develop.  I will describe how deep learning and sparse-coding techniques can be used to build systems that have very high compression levels (50x or more is typical) and which have the very interesting property that the resulting compressed data can often be queried or analyzed directly without ever decompressing the data.  Moreover, it is possible to selectively decompress signals only from desired time ranges within a compressed batch. </p> <p>These new techniques for building time series data bases enable some exciting capabilities. The benefits include the ability to do query push-down into the time-series database from systems like Apache Drill, better visualization systems, and the ability to build an interesting form of anomaly detector on top of the time-series database.</p> <p>I will describe how to build these systems using Apache Mahout and illustrate the results with several real examples\". </p> <p><b>Special thanks to Saba El-Hilo for organizing this.</b></p> <p><br/>• 6:00PM Doors are open, feel free to mingle</p> <p>• 6:20 Presentation starts</p> <p>• 8:00 Off to a nearby watering hole (Mr. Brownstone?) for a pint, food, and/or breakout discussions</p> <p><b>Getting There</b></p> <p>By transit there a number of high frequency buses (check Google Maps or the Translink site for your particular case) that will get you there.
